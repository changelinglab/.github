This is the GitHub organization for [Changling Lab](https://changelinglab.github.io).

ChangeLing Lab is Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s only research lab focused on understanding how languages change, and how these patterns of change shape the way that languages are at any given point in time, from a computational perspective. We are interested in phonetics, phonology, and morphology (whether diachronic or synchronic), emergent communication, and have a special concern for the use of language science to benefit people with disabilities.
